// Pillars

// There are pillars near the road. The distance between the pillars is the same and the width of the pillars is the same. Your function accepts three arguments:

// number of pillars (â‰¥ 1);
// distance between pillars (10 - 30 meters);
// width of the pillar (10 - 50 centimeters).
// Calculate the distance between the first and the last pillar in centimeters (without the width of the first and last pillar).

// parameters number of pillas, distance between pillars, width of pillars
// return integer
// examples
// pseudo code check to see if the number of pillars is less than 2 and return 0, then check to see if the number of pillars is less than 3 and if it is return the distance between pillars mulitplied by 100, otherwise subtract two from the pillars and multiply the width then subtract one from the number of pillars and multiply it by the distance, add the result of both expressions together

function pillars(numPill, dist, width) {
  if (numPill < 2) {
    return 0;
  } else if (numPill <= 3) {
    return dist * 100;
  } else {
    return (numPill - 2) * width + (numPill - 1) * (dist * 100);
  }
}

console.log(pillars(1, 10, 10)); // 0

console.log(pillars(2, 20, 25)); // 2000

console.log(pillars(11, 15, 30)); // 15270

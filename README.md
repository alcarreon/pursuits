# Code Wars Challenges!

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** Javascript
I try to do a CodeWars challenge at least once a day.

## Optimizations

I compare my code with the top answers to try and see similarities between how I think and other top rated people think. I then try to refactor my code into a more elgeant way for readability and efficiency.

## Lessons Learned:

I have learned that the process is more important than the individual products of my codewars challenges. Keeping my mind sharp and thinking in different perspectives helps me to better bridge the divide between the technical aspects of my solutions and the social implications they can have as a result of my design.
